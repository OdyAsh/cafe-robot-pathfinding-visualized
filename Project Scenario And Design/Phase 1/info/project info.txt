approaches: representations: spaces, grid, graphs, etc

plans == assumptions: tray is on top of it, so it occupies the same cell

previous labs: spaces representation

b) notations == operations
operation: delete, add, pre-condition
examples: pseudocode (say for example

strategies: algorithm chosen (A*, etc)
before that: compare between all algorithms 

suitability: 4ar7 el justification and why this algorithm works
